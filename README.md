Articulate
==========

Articulate is a book maker for Wikipedia. Wikipedia also has book making capabilities, but books with more content get big real fast. 
This script makes an HTML book. You can make your own themes. More website to be supported soon.

Running
-------

Install dependencies from the requirements.txt file. The format for a book is :

```
new <bookname> <num_pages like 2>
<page 1 name from wiki>
<page 2 name from wiki>
.
.
.
[new <bookname> ...]
end (ends the program)
```

See the input.in file for a sample. It'll spit output in the output folder. Make an output folder pls.

Right now it looks mighty ugly, improvements coming soon.

Made for preparing for TCS IT Wiz 2014.
